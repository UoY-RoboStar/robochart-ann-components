15 nodes, 

insize = 5
outsize = 5
layerstructure = <5, 5, 5>
layerNo = #layerstructure 
maxSize = 5

15 nodes in a few SECONDS? but it runs out of memory for (10,10,5)? I think its the input node.

TRy this.

MAYBE SEPARATING THE INPUT LAYER? Assumes 15 inputs? THat is not very scalable

Try separating the input layer? 

maxSize seems to make a gigantic difference. 

Input again, remove the input layer, have each layer started with A SPECIFIC VALUE? 

3GB or so, few minutes

11GB for 25,
