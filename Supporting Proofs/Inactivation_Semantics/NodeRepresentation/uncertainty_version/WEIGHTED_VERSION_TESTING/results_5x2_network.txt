Under ALL inputs: 
InputLayer = 
	(; i : <0..insize-1> @ ( NodePhase.0.(insize - i).(Inactive.weak) -> SKIP ))


Acas xu 1-1 params with these CONSTANTS:


insize = 5
outsize = 5
layerstructure = <5, 5>
layerNo = #layerstructure 
maxSize = 5

Results: 

MAX: 

2.5 - Active.Strong
2.4 - Active.strong
2.3 - Active.strong
2.2 - Active.medium
2.1 - Active.weak

MIN: 
2.5 - Zero 
2.4 - Zero
2.3 - Zero
2.2 - Zero
2.1 - Active.medium

MIN WITH MAX BIAS: 
2.5 - Active.strong 
2.4 - Zero 
2.3 - Active.strong 
2.2 - Zero
2.1 - Active.Strong

Min of : 
Max of: 
Min of: 2.5 - Active.strong
And min of: 2.3 - Active.strong 

WHAT DECISIONS CANNOT BE MADE: 
MAX of:
2.2 - medium 
2.2 CANNOT BE MADE, INACTIVE. 

Under any valuation, Under any situation. 
IS INACTIVE, under any, inputs  less than -0.01. 

Could there be a combination we are missing, 

Is this even the true range? 

Max isnt the max, but is the range the actual range? 

1 node, in each layer, 2 layers. 




TELLS US NOTHING. 

2.1 weights: 
Inactive.medium
Active.weak 
Inactive.medium 
Active.medium
Inative.medium 

What about the bias? 

Maybe the bias is wrong? 

Active.weak 

That shouldnt have been more under min? 

bias calculation, its the lowest possible bias calculation, 

weird results, always assumes that bias will be under




DRY RUN: 

2 inputs, 1 hidden node, one output node: 

with acas xu: 

insize = 2
outsize = 1
layerstructure = <1,1>
layerNo = #layerstructure 
maxSize = 2

under both Inactive.weak 



Min simulation: 

2.1.Active.medium 

Max simulation: 

2.1.Active.medium 

Is this the actual range? Hypothesis, is the true range. 

Let's see: 

weights: 
node 1-1: 
Active.weak 
Inactive.strong 

bias: 
Active.medium 

Node 2-1:
weight: 
Inactive.medium 

bias: 
Active.weak 

Input node: Inactive.weak 

Weighted sum: 

Inactive.weak * Active.weak + 
Inactive.weak * Inactive.strong 

+ 

Active.medium 

Multiplicaiton: 

Inactive.weak + 
Active.weak + 

Active.medium 

What are the possiblilities? 

MINIMAL, there is an ABSOLUTE MININUM: 

Worst case: 
Inactive.weak + 

Active.medium 

WORST, active.weak, can it lead to inactive? No, because highest is: 

-0.099
+ 
LOWEST; 
0.01 

STILL ACTIVE.WEAK 

HIGHEST, is: 

Active.weak + active.medium 

medium, 0.99 + 0.01

ACTIVE.STRONG. 

Active.weak -> Active.strong

Any WAY THIS COULD BE DIFFERENT? 

No, not under this input combination? 

Minimum and MAXIMUM run

2.1 - 

Check with Marabou. 

I think this is sound, 

IF WE EVALUATE EACH NODES MINIMUM, DOES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE LIMITS OF THE NETWORK? 

MAXIMAL LIMIT, I think it does. 

Could be medium, but we are evaluating both bounds. 

I think, each is monotonic, we have this property. 

It may not be less or greater, but it CAN'T BE ANYTHING ELSE. 


weight: 
Inactive.medium 

bias: 
Active.weak 

Inactive.medium, 

Each node, can't be any different, can NEVER BE, under that input valuation, OUTSIDE OF THOSE BOUNDS. 

Even with uncertainty, because of how we've done it, NO WAY IT CAN BE OUTSIDE THOSE RANGES. 

Intermediate combinations, 

BIAS HAS TO BE MIN, CAN'T ASSUME IT WILL ALWAYS BE MAX, HAS TO BE THE MIN AND MAX CALCULATION FOR ENTIRE 

NETWORK, BIAS HAS TO BE FACTORED IN.
