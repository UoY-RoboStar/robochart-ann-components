ANN Circus rules, in TeX. 

Contents of this document: 
- A Z specification capturing the RoboChart ANNController class, used in the metalanguage. 
- The denotational semantic rules for formalising ANNControllers, from RoboChart, in Circus. 
- This tex file contains the rules followed by the AnglePIDANN example. 
- Notes: a list of differences between this semantics and the CSP semantics, and potential problems or questions about the rules. 
- ANN Circus semantics in the Circus metamodel.
- Appendix A: AnglePIDANN2, a binarised version of AnglePIDANN, with additional layers, to make an example with more than one hidden layer. 
- Appendix B: The CSP semantics sketch, the final version, after some minor updates, that matches the CSPM used in proofs closely.
